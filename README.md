# ClassificationWithLDA-Adaboost

Problem Statement :-

Create custom classification models using the wine dataset and evaluate your model results. Split the dataset into training and test dataset 80:20.

 a) Create a logistics regression, LDA, decision tree, and AdaBoost models. Fit the model using the training dataset and find the model accuracy and confusion matrix. Explain each model's outcome, finding, and accuracy. 
 
 b) Predict the models using the test dataset, and provide the performance metrics. Compare the five models' performance metrics, and explain at least four findings on each of the models. 

 c) Do you see any overfitting and underfitting issues on each model? How to overcome the overfitting/underfitting issues in your custom models? Provide the information model by model.

d) List down the important features in each model? How did you choose those important features? Why is it an important feature of the model? Explain with some statistical evidence.
